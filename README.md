#Self reflective association

I want to be able to see who my `Users` have been `Emailing` on my  website.

The association I will be setting up for this will be with `User` and `Emails`. `User` can `Email` any other `User` which will create an `Emailing` instance. A particular `User` can have many `Emailed Users` and can have been `Emailed By` many users. If I `Email` someone I be the `Sender` and the other party will be the `Receiver`.
